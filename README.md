JellyTunes is a desktop app for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) users who want their music offline. Browse the artists, album artists, albums, playlists and genres on your server, pick a destination such as an MP3 player, a USB drive, an SD card or any local folder, and hit sync. JellyTunes downloads the tracks, converts formats when needed, embeds lyrics and cover art, and mirrors your server's folder structure at the destination.

## Key Features

- **Browse your full library** — artists, album artists, albums, playlists, and genres pulled directly from your Jellyfin server
- **Sync anywhere** — USB drives, SD cards, and local folders all work as destinations
- **Selective sync** — only downloads what's new or changed; skips tracks already at the destination
- **Out-of-sync detection** — tracks that changed on the server since the last sync are automatically flagged for update
- **Sync preview** — a three-column breakdown of exactly what will be added, updated, or removed — with per-category track count, size, and duration — before you commit to a sync
- **FLAC to MP3 conversion** — built-in FFmpeg support with configurable bitrate (128k / 192k / 320k); settings saved per device
- **Lyrics sync** — download `.lrc` sidecar files or embed lyrics directly into tracks (supports Jellyfin 10.9+ JSON lyrics); mode is configurable per device
- **Cover art modes** — embed cover art into each track or write companion `cover.jpg` files; chosen per device and persisted
- **ReplayGain tags** — ReplayGain metadata from Jellyfin is embedded into synced tracks for consistent playback volume
- **Smart storage bar** — visual capacity indicator with live size estimates; warns when your selection exceeds free space
- **Smart filesystem handling** — auto-detects FAT32, exFAT, and NTFS; sanitizes filenames accordingly
- **Per-destination history** — remembers what was synced to each device or folder so you can pick up where you left off
- **Cancel anytime** — stop a sync mid-progress without corrupting what's already been written

Prefer a direct download? Every platform is built on each release — grab yours from [the latest release](https://github.com/orainlabs/jellytunes/releases/latest):

| Platform    | File        | Notes                                       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**   | `.dmg`      | Apple silicon and Intel                     |
| **Windows** | `.exe`      | Installer                                   |
| **Linux**   | `.deb`      | Debian and Ubuntu                           |
| **Linux**   | `.AppImage` | AppImage (legacy) — see [Linux installation and migration](docs/INSTALLATION.md) |

Open the installer and follow the prompts. FFmpeg is bundled with every package, so there is nothing else to install.

The `.snap` is not attached to the release on purpose: a file downloaded from GitHub carries no store signature and `snap install` will reject it. Use the Snap Store button above. For the full Linux picture, including the AppImage migration path, see the [Linux installation and migration](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

### macOS: "App is damaged" or Gatekeeper warning

JellyTunes is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. macOS may block it on first launch, especially on macOS 15 (Sequoia). To open it:

**Option A — via Terminal (recommended):**

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/JellyTunes.app
```

Then open the app normally.

**Option B — via System Settings:**

1. Try to open the app (it will be blocked)
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Security**
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the JellyTunes entry

### Windows: "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen)

JellyTunes is not signed with a code-signing certificate, so Windows SmartScreen may show a blue **"Windows protected your PC"** warning the first time you run the installer. To proceed:

1. Click **"More info"** on the warning dialog
2. Click the **"Run anyway"** button that appears
3. Continue through the installer as normal

This only happens on first run.

### Prerequisites

- A [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) server reachable on your network
- A USB drive, SD card, local folder, or any mounted storage device as destination

## Development

Everything below is for contributors and developers who want to build JellyTunes from source.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orainlabs/jellytunes.git
cd jellytunes
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and launches the Electron window.

**Requirements**: Node.js 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

### Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start dev server + Electron
pnpm build            # Compile with electron-vite
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript type checking

# Testing
pnpm test             # Unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:unit:watch  # Unit tests in watch mode
pnpm test:bdd         # BDD tests headless (Cucumber + Playwright)
pnpm test:bdd:dev     # BDD tests with visible UI

# Packaging
pnpm package          # Build + create installers
```

### Architecture

Three Electron processes plus a standalone sync engine:

- **Main process** (`src/main/`) — IPC handlers, USB/filesystem detection, sync orchestration
- **Preload** (`src/preload/`) — typed IPC bridge between main and renderer
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) — React UI for library navigation, device selection, and sync progress
- **Sync module** (`src/sync/`) — dependency-injected sync engine (API client, file ops, FFmpeg converter); fully unit-testable without hitting the network or filesystem
